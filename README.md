# docker-stacks

Opinionated stacks of ready-to-run Jupyter applications in Docker.

```
docker run -d -P jupyter/<your desired stack>
```

## Getting Started

If this is your first time using Docker or any of the Jupyter projects, do the following to get started.

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) on your host of choice.
2. Click the folder for your desired stack on GitHub.
3. Follow the README in that stack.
